My [Stripe-CTF Writeup](http://muehe.org/posts/stripe-ctf-3-writeup/) actually made it 4th place on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and I just wanted to share how that looks in Google Analytics. Sufficient to say I was very happy with hosting a static, Jekyll generated blog on Github.io when I was the realtime analytics numbers climb beyond 300 concurrent visitors. Also, my Alexa rank jumped about 25,000,000 places to 300000th most visited website in the US. Good times, thank you.
